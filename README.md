These values, and their definitions, have been determined through limited research and self-reflection,
rather than scientific research.
They are geared towards questions of disability and infirmity,
to help those with limited resources determine how to prioritise.

## Making changes

All of this code, including the list of values and definitions,
is released under the MIT license (see side-bar, or the LICENSE file).

This website is written using TypeScript, which is then compiled (transpiled) to JavaScript.
Simply running `tsc` from the main folder should compile the project.

## Versioning

Notable changes are given a new version number,
but this is mostly hidden from the user.
Specific versions can be linked by replacing the "/latest/" part of the URL
with the version number.
