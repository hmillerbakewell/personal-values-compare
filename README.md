# personal-values-compare

This website makes it easy to determine, in order, one's top five values from a list.
It does this via rounds of binary comparison,
assuming a poset structure on values.

These values are:

 - Adventure: Finding new excitements
 - Independence: Living without routine assistance
 - Appearance: Beauty, presence, and fashion
 - Boldness: Doing what few dare to do
 - Compassion: Easing the pains of strangers
 - Challenge: Pushing yourself, regardless of the goal
 - Community: Being part of a wider group
 - Competency: Building skills in a particular field
 - Visual Arts and Crafts: Creating or admiring
 - Curiosity: Finding new ideas
 - Determination: Finishing what you start
 - Faith: Connection to something beyond humanity
 - Fame: Being known to all
 - Friendships: Deep relationships with a select few
 - Influence: Power over others

 - Performing Arts: Attending or performing

 - Peace: Peace within yourself
 - Pleasure: Treating yourself well
 - Popularity: Being liked, but not perhaps known, by a large group

 - Reputation: The things strangers know you for
 - Responsibility: Being trusted by others
 - Stability: Confidence that next week will be like this week
 - Sports: Attending or playing

These values, and their definitions, have been determined through limited research and self-reflection,
rather than scientific research.
